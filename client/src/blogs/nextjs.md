In today’s fast-paced world, technology is advancing at an unprecedented rate, and one of the most dynamic and rapidly evolving fields is web development.
The web development landscape has expanded significantly in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for innovative and interactive online experiences.

React.js is a popular framework of JavaScript to work on with Front-End Development . The introduction of React.js gave a solid boost in web development .
React.js provides content reusability option , its creates a virtual DOM through which the updates in states/props are reflected in webpage quickly .

Next.js is a React.js framework . It is a `Full-Stack framework` ,can be used for both front-end and Back-end work

Next.js can be installed using the command : `npx create-next-app app-name`

## 1.Routing -
> *The mechanism by which requests (as specified by a URL and HTTP method) are routed to the code that handles them*
In React.js the routing is carried out by using a package called react-router-Dom , we use Browser-Router , Routes , Route to carry out routings.<br/>

We just place all our Pages inside Route element and give it a path (a URL) and then cover it up with Routes , and then cover our entire app component inside Browser-Router which help in Routing

Meanwhile, Next.js supports `file-based routing`. When we look into the Next.js folder structure, we can see a folder called “app”. 
This is where we place all our website pages. For example, if we want to create a login page, we simply need to create a folder named “login” inside the “app” folder.
Inside this “login” folder, we have to create either page.js or page.ts.

## 2. Rendering -
> *The process of generating and displaying the visual representation of a web page or web application in a user’s web browser*
React.js follows `Client-side-rendering` and Next.js follows `Server-side-rendering`.

Client-side-rendering :- Whenever the user request for any HTML then server Sends all the HTML, CSS, JavaScript files to the user’s web browser.
The user’s web browser then renders all these files and create a proper HTML and serve it to the user.

Server-side-rendering :- Server-side-rendering is a part of `pre-rendering` , in which whenever user request for any HTML then server itself generates the final HTML and give it to user’s browser .
For Every request a new rendering happens.

The advantage of server-side-rendering is that `SEO` (Search Engine Optimization ) easily gets the server side rendered data which helps to rank ahead in SEO ,
this means that the website using SSR can get a higher rank / can get indexed quickly through which they can rank in the top of the google search page.

Next.js provides both server-side-rendering and client-side-rendering . The by default rendering is server-side ,
if we want to use client-side-components then we have to specify "use client" at the top the page which we want to render in client-side.

Client-side components such as click events and on change events are not allowed to render in server-side ,
hence we have to specify them in a client-components and import this client component in our server component.

## 3.Next.js for Back-End -
> *Next.js can be used for both frontend and backend.*
- Node.js for Backend: Start by creating a new folder named “next-server.” You can create a Next.js app using the following command:- npx create-next-app next-server After setting up your Next.js app, create a “db.js” file at the folder level and write the database connection code within this file.
- Organize API Routes: Inside the “app” folder of your Next.js project, create a new directory named “api.” In this directory, you will organize your API routes based on their URLs. For example, if the API URL is “http://xyz.com/api/newPost,” create a new file named “newPost.js” and place all the API functionality for this endpoint within this file.
- Import the Database Functionality: In every API file you create (e.g., “newPost.js”), make sure to import the “db.js” function to establish a database connection and access the necessary database operations. This step allows you to interact with your database seamlessly within your API routes.


In conclusion, Next.js stands out as a powerful framework that builds upon the capabilities of React.js while addressing many of its limitations. Its server-side rendering, static site generation, and routing features make it an excellent choice for building modern web applications that prioritize performance, SEO, and user experience. While React.js remains an invaluable library for creating dynamic user interfaces, Next.js takes it a step further by simplifying server-side rendering and providing a well-rounded ecosystem for full-stack web development.
